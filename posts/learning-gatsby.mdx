After installing gatsby-plugin-mdx, MDX files located in src/pages will turn into pages.

Pages are rendered at a URL that is constructed from the filesystem path inside src/pages. An MDX file at src/pages/awesome.mdx will result in a page being rendered at mysite.com/awesome.

gatsby-plugin-mdx looks for MDX files and automatically transpiles them so that Gatsby internals can render them.

```js
let example = "egghead";

const Hello = "code highlights is not working";
```
